Azure Data Factory Workflow

Objective: To create a data workflow using Azure Data Factory.

Task:

Introduction to Azure Data Factory Workflow:

Provide an introduction to data workflows, data processing, and integration.
Introduce Azure Data Factory as a cloud-based data integration service provided by Microsoft Azure.
Data Sources and Destinations:

Instruct students to identify and select data sources and destinations for their Azure Data Factory workflow. These could include databases, files, cloud storage, or external APIs.
Data Transformation Requirements:

Define specific data transformation requirements that students should implement as part of their Azure Data Factory workflow. These requirements may include but are not limited to:
Data cleansing and validation.
Data enrichment.
Aggregation or summarization.
Data format conversion.
Azure Data Factory Workflow Development:

Assign students the task of developing the data workflow using Azure Data Factory. They should use the Azure portal and Data Factory Designer to create data pipelines, datasets, and linked services.
Data Extraction:

Guide students in configuring data extraction activities within their data pipelines to read data from the selected source(s).
Data Transformation:

Describe the data transformation logic students should apply to meet the defined requirements. They can use Azure Data Factory's built-in data flow transformations and custom activities as needed.
Data Loading:

Instruct students on how to configure data loading activities within their data pipelines to store the processed data in the selected destination(s).
Workflow Scheduling:

Explain the importance of scheduling data workflows for regular or on-demand execution. Instruct students on how to create triggers and schedules within Azure Data Factory.
Testing and Validation:

Ask students to thoroughly test their Azure Data Factory workflow to ensure that data is extracted, transformed, and loaded correctly.
Emphasize the importance of data validation and error handling.
Documentation:

Require students to provide comprehensive documentation of their Azure Data Factory workflow. Documentation should include:
Overview of the workflow and its purpose.
Description of data sources, destinations, and transformations.
Instructions for scheduling and monitoring the workflow.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their Azure Data Factory workflow and share their experiences with the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and functionality of the Azure Data Factory workflow.
Clarity and organization of documentation.
Correctness and effectiveness of data transformations.
Thoroughness of testing and validation.
Ability to present findings effectively (if applicable).
