Google Dataflow Pipeline

Objective: To build a data pipeline using Google Dataflow.

Task:

Introduction to Google Dataflow Pipeline:

Provide an introduction to data pipelines and their importance in data processing and analysis.
Introduce Google Dataflow as a managed data processing service provided by Google Cloud.
Data Source and Target Selection:

Instruct students to select a source dataset and a target location for their Dataflow pipeline. The source could be a publicly available dataset, and the target could be Google Cloud Storage.
Data Transformation Requirements:

Define specific data transformation requirements that students should implement as part of their Dataflow pipeline. These requirements may include but are not limited to:
Data filtering.
Data cleansing and validation.
Aggregation or summarization.
Data format conversion.
Google Dataflow Pipeline Development:

Assign students the task of developing the data pipeline using Google Dataflow. They should use the Google Cloud Console or Apache Beam SDK for Python (if preferred) to create their pipeline.
Data Extraction:

Guide students in configuring the extraction process to read data from the selected source dataset.
Data Transformation:

Describe the data transformation logic students should apply to meet the defined requirements. They can use Google Dataflow's built-in transformations and custom user-defined functions (UDFs) as needed.
Data Loading:

Instruct students on how to configure the loading process to store the processed data in Google Cloud Storage, specifying the target location and file format (e.g., Parquet, CSV).
Testing and Validation:

Ask students to thoroughly test their Dataflow pipeline to ensure that data is extracted, transformed, and loaded correctly.
Emphasize the importance of data validation and error handling.
Documentation:

Require students to provide comprehensive documentation of their Google Dataflow pipeline. Documentation should include:
Overview of the pipeline and its purpose.
Description of source and target data structures.
Details of data transformations.
Instructions for running and monitoring the Dataflow job.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their Google Dataflow pipeline and share their experiences with the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and functionality of the Google Dataflow pipeline.
Clarity and organization of documentation.
Correctness and effectiveness of data transformations.
Thoroughness of testing and validation.
Ability to present findings effectively (if applicable).
