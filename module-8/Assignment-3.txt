AWS Glue ETL Pipeline

Objective: To build an ETL pipeline using AWS Glue.

Task:

Introduction to AWS Glue ETL:

Provide an introduction to the concept of ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines and their significance in data processing and integration.
Introduce AWS Glue as a managed ETL service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS).
Data Source and Target Selection:

Instruct students to select a source and target for their ETL pipeline. The source could be data stored in AWS S3, and the target could be AWS Redshift, but other combinations are also acceptable.
Data Transformation Requirements:

Define specific data transformation requirements that students should implement as part of their ETL pipeline. These requirements may include but are not limited to:
Data filtering.
Data cleansing and validation.
Data aggregation or enrichment.
Data format conversion.
AWS Glue ETL Development:

Assign students the task of developing the ETL pipeline using AWS Glue. They should use AWS Glue's ETL development environment and tools.
Instruct them to create AWS Glue jobs, crawlers, and data catalog entries as needed for their pipeline.
Data Extraction:

Guide students in configuring the extraction process to retrieve data from the selected source, ensuring proper data schema inference and cataloging.
Data Transformation:

Describe the data transformation logic students should apply to meet the defined requirements. Encourage them to use AWS Glue's built-in transformation capabilities and custom scripts if necessary.
Data Loading:

Instruct students on how to configure the loading process to insert or update data in the target storage (e.g., AWS Redshift) while maintaining data integrity.
Testing and Validation:

Ask students to thoroughly test their ETL pipeline to ensure that data is extracted, transformed, and loaded correctly.
Emphasize the importance of data validation and error handling.
Documentation:

Require students to provide comprehensive documentation of their AWS Glue ETL pipeline. Documentation should include:
Overview of the pipeline and its purpose.
Description of source and target data structures.
Details of data transformations.
Instructions for running and monitoring the ETL job.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their AWS Glue ETL pipeline and share their experiences with the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and functionality of the AWS Glue ETL pipeline.
Clarity and organization of documentation.
Correctness and effectiveness of data transformations.
Thoroughness of testing and validation.
Ability to present findings effectively (if applicable).
