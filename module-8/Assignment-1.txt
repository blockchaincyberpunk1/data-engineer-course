Cloud Service Comparison

Objective: To compare cloud data services.

Task:

Introduction to Cloud Service Comparison:

Provide an introduction to the importance of comparing cloud data services and their role in data storage, processing, analytics, and pricing.
Choice of Cloud Providers:

Instruct students to choose three major cloud providers for comparison. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. These providers offer a wide range of data services.
Comparison Criteria:

Define the criteria for comparison, which should include but not be limited to:
Data Storage: Compare offerings for data storage services, including object storage, databases, and data warehouses.
Data Processing: Analyze capabilities for data processing, including batch and stream processing services.
Data Analytics: Evaluate data analytics services, such as machine learning, data lakes, and visualization tools.
Pricing and Cost Management: Compare pricing models, cost management tools, and cost-effective options.
Research and Documentation:

Instruct students to research and gather information on the selected cloud providers' data services, including official documentation, pricing details, and use cases.
Students should consider real-world examples, customer testimonials, and case studies.
Comparison Document or Presentation:

Ask students to create a comparison document (e.g., a report or spreadsheet) or a presentation that effectively compares the three selected cloud providers based on the defined criteria.
Encourage students to use tables, charts, and visuals to present the comparison information clearly.
Use Case Scenarios:

Have students provide specific use case scenarios where each cloud provider's data services are well-suited. This helps demonstrate their understanding of practical applications.
Conclusion and Recommendations:

Encourage students to conclude their comparison by summarizing the key findings and making recommendations based on specific business needs or scenarios.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their cloud service comparison document or presentation to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and accuracy of the cloud service comparison.
Clarity and organization of the document or presentation.
Depth of analysis in comparing the selected cloud providers' offerings.
Quality of use case scenarios and recommendations.
Ability to present findings effectively.
