Data Validation Script

Objective: To implement data validation.

Task:

Introduction to Data Validation:

Provide an introduction to the importance of data validation in data processing and the role it plays in ensuring data quality.
Dataset and Data Validation Task:

Share a dataset with students. The dataset should contain a mix of structured and semi-structured data in a common format (e.g., CSV, JSON).
Instruct students to write a Python or Java script that performs data validation on the provided dataset.
Data Validation Criteria:

Define the data validation criteria that students should apply. These criteria may include but are not limited to:
Missing Values: Check for missing values in the dataset and report the rows or columns where they occur.
Data Types: Validate data types of columns (e.g., numeric, text) and identify any mismatches.
Outliers: Detect outliers in numeric columns using appropriate statistical methods.
Consistency Checks: Perform consistency checks (e.g., date ranges, value ranges) specific to the dataset's domain.
Duplicate Records: Identify and report duplicate records, if applicable.
Script Development:

Instruct students to write a Python or Java script that implements the data validation criteria. They should include functions or methods for each validation type.
Validation Report:

Require students to generate a validation report as the output of their script. The report should include:
Summary of the validation results, including the number of missing values, data type discrepancies, and outliers.
Detailed information on rows or columns that do not meet the validation criteria.
Recommendations or actions to address data quality issues.
Testing and Documentation:

Ask students to thoroughly test their validation script with the provided dataset and document the script's usage, including input parameters and expected output.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their data validation script and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the data validation script.
Clarity and organization of the validation report.
Quality and effectiveness of data validation methods.
Ability to accurately detect and report data quality issues.
Documentation and testing of the script.
