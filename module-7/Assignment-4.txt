Data Catalog Development

Objective: To build a basic data catalog.

Task:

Introduction to Data Catalogs:

Provide an introduction to the concept of data catalogs, their significance in data management, and their role in organizing and discovering data assets.
Data Catalog Development Scenario:

Describe the scenario: Students are tasked with developing a basic data catalog for a fictional organization named "DataCatalogCo."
Choice of Data Catalog Tool/Framework:

Instruct students to choose a data catalog tool or framework for this assignment. Options include Apache Atlas, open-source alternatives, or a simplified custom solution if they have the necessary development skills.
Catalog a Sample Dataset:

Share a sample dataset (e.g., CSV, JSON, or database) with students. The dataset should contain various data assets that need to be cataloged.
Ask students to catalog the dataset by:
Defining metadata attributes (e.g., column names, data types, description).
Associating data assets with relevant categories or classifications.
Specifying ownership and access permissions.
Metadata and Tagging:

Emphasize the importance of associating metadata and tags with data assets. Instruct students to provide meaningful metadata attributes for the cataloged dataset.
Search and Discovery:

Require students to demonstrate the search and discovery capabilities of the developed data catalog. Users should be able to search for data assets based on metadata attributes, tags, or keywords.
User-Friendly Interface:

Encourage students to design a user-friendly interface for the data catalog, making it intuitive and easy to navigate.
Documentation:

Instruct students to provide comprehensive documentation, including:
Overview of the data catalog development process.
Description of the cataloged dataset and metadata attributes.
Instructions for using the catalog, including search and discovery features.
Any customization or extensions made to the chosen data catalog tool/framework.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their data catalog and its features to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and functionality of the developed data catalog.
Clarity and organization of the cataloged dataset and metadata.
Effectiveness of search and discovery features.
User-friendliness and interface design.
Documentation and instructions for using the catalog.
