Metadata Documentation

Objective: To document metadata for data governance.

Task:

Introduction to Metadata Documentation:

Provide an introduction to the importance of metadata documentation in data governance and its role in ensuring data quality and lineage tracking.
Dataset and Metadata Documentation Task:

Share a dataset with students. The dataset should be in a common format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and represent real or fictional data relevant to a business scenario.
Instruct students to create comprehensive metadata documentation for the provided dataset. This documentation should include descriptions, data lineage, and annotations for data quality issues.
Metadata Documentation Components:

Define the components of metadata documentation that students should include:
a. Data Description: Provide a detailed description of the dataset, including its purpose, source, and relevance.
b. Data Lineage: Document the source of the data, transformations applied, and any downstream systems or processes that use the data.
c. Data Quality Annotations: Annotate data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies, and describe the impact on data analysis.
Choice of Tools/Frameworks:

Allow students to choose between using metadata documentation tools (e.g., Apache Ambari, Apache Atlas) or developing custom scripts or documentation templates.
Documentation Format:

Instruct students to use a structured format for their metadata documentation. This can include text documents, spreadsheets, or structured JSON or XML files.
Data Lineage Visualization:

Encourage students to visualize data lineage using flowcharts or diagrams to make it easier to understand the data's journey.
Annotations and Data Quality Reporting:

Require students to include annotations for data quality issues found in the dataset. These annotations should describe the issue, its severity, and potential corrective actions.
Ask students to include a data quality report summarizing the overall quality of the dataset.
Testing and Documentation:

Ask students to thoroughly test their metadata documentation approach with the provided dataset and document the process of creating metadata documentation.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their metadata documentation and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and accuracy of metadata documentation.
Clarity and organization of data descriptions, data lineage, and data quality annotations.
Effectiveness in visualizing data lineage.
Quality of data quality reporting and annotations.
Documentation and testing of the metadata documentation process.
