Specify compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
Address consent management and data subject rights.
b. Data Security Policy:

Establish policies for safeguarding data assets from unauthorized access, breaches, and cyber threats.
Outline encryption standards, access controls, and security protocols.
Define incident response procedures in case of data breaches.
c. Data Access Control Policy:

Define access control policies and procedures, including role-based access.
Specify who has access to different types of data and under what conditions.
Address data sharing and collaboration guidelines within and outside the organization.
d. Data Quality Standards:

Address data disposal and destruction procedures.
f. Data Governance Framework:

Define the organizational structure for data governance, including roles (e.g., Data Steward, Data Owner) and responsibilities.
Specify the governance process for decision-making, issue resolution, and policy enforcement.
Documentation and Rationale:

Require students to provide rationale and explanations for each policy, citing reasons for their design choices.
Compliance and Audit:

Discuss the importance of compliance and audit mechanisms for ensuring that data governance policies are adhered to. Encourage students to include audit trails and monitoring procedures.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their data governance policy document to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and comprehensiveness of the data governance policy document.
Clarity and organization of the policies and explanations.
Adherence to best practices in data governance.
Consideration of data privacy, security, access control, and data quality standards.
Ability to justify policy design choices.
