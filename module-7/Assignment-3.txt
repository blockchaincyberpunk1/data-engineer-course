Metadata Extraction

Objective: To understand metadata extraction.

Task:

Introduction to Metadata Extraction:

Provide an introduction to the importance of metadata in data management and its role in understanding and organizing data assets.
Dataset and Metadata Extraction Task:

Share a dataset with students. The dataset should be in a common format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and contain a mix of structured and semi-structured data.
Instruct students to write code (in a programming language of their choice, such as Python or Java) to automatically extract metadata from the provided dataset.
Metadata Extraction Criteria:

Define the metadata extraction criteria that students should apply. These criteria may include but are not limited to:
Column Names: Extract and store the names of all columns in the dataset.
Data Types: Identify and record the data types of each column (e.g., text, numeric, date).
Data Statistics: Calculate basic statistics for numeric columns, such as mean, median, and standard deviation.
Data Cardinality: Determine the cardinality (number of unique values) for each column.
Data Format: Identify any specific data formats (e.g., date formats) used in the dataset.
Metadata Catalog Creation:

Instruct students to create a metadata catalog or repository that stores the extracted metadata information. This can be in the form of a database, a structured file (e.g., JSON or XML), or any suitable data storage mechanism.
Code Development:

Require students to write code that performs the metadata extraction based on the defined criteria. They should use programming libraries or frameworks as needed.
Testing and Documentation:

Ask students to thoroughly test their metadata extraction code with the provided dataset and document how to use the code, including input parameters and expected output.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their metadata extraction code and the resulting metadata catalog to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the metadata extraction code.
Clarity and organization of the metadata catalog or repository.
Quality and accuracy of the extracted metadata information.
Ability to handle various data types and formats.
Documentation and testing of the code.
