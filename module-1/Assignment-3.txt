Data Lifecycle Diagram

Objective: To visualize the stages of the data lifecycle.

Task:

Data Lifecycle Overview:

Provide an overview of the concept of a data lifecycle. Explain that it encompasses the stages through which data passes from its creation to its final use or disposal.
Stages of the Data Lifecycle:

Identify and describe the key stages of the data lifecycle: data generation, data collection, data storage, data processing, and data consumption.
For each stage, explain its significance in the overall data management process.
Visual Diagram Creation:

Instruct students to create a visual diagram or flowchart that represents the data lifecycle.
Use appropriate symbols, shapes, and connecting lines to illustrate the flow of data between stages.
Label each stage clearly and include a brief description or key characteristics.
Annotations and Descriptions:

Beneath or adjacent to each stage in the diagram, include annotations or descriptions that explain what happens during that stage.
Describe any key considerations, technologies, or processes associated with each stage.
Data Example:

Provide a simple example or scenario to demonstrate how data would flow through the various stages of the data lifecycle. This can help students contextualize their diagrams.
Presentation:

Ask students to present their data lifecycle diagrams to the class or submit them in a digital format (e.g., as an image or PDF).
During presentations, students should explain their diagram's design choices and how it effectively represents the data lifecycle.
Peer Review:

Encourage students to review and provide feedback on their peers' diagrams during the presentation phase. This can foster discussion and help students refine their understanding of the data lifecycle.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and comprehensibility of the data lifecycle diagram.
Accuracy and completeness of the descriptions for each stage.
Presentation quality and effectiveness in explaining the diagram.
Thoughtful incorporation of key concepts related to data lifecycle management.
