Spark Streaming

Objective: To explore stream processing with Apache Spark.

Task:

Introduction to Spark Streaming:

Provide an introduction to Apache Spark Streaming and its significance in real-time data processing and analytics.
Data Stream Source:

Set up a data stream source for students to use in their Spark Streaming application. This can be a Kafka topic, a socket source, or any other streaming data source.
Real-Time Stream Processing Task:

Instruct students to build a real-time stream processing application using Apache Spark Streaming. They should:
Configure Spark Streaming to consume data from the provided data stream source.
Define and apply windowed computations or operations on the incoming data stream.
Produce streaming results or aggregations based on the windowed data.
Types of Stream Processing:

Specify the types of stream processing operations students should perform, such as:
Windowed Computations: Calculations over a defined time window (e.g., time-based aggregations).
Filtering: Selecting specific data records from the stream.
Mapping: Transforming or enriching data within the stream.
Joining: Combining data from multiple streams if applicable.
Code Structure and Documentation:

Encourage students to structure their Spark Streaming code in a clear and organized manner.
Require them to provide comments and documentation explaining the purpose of each section of the code, especially when applying Spark Streaming operations.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their Spark Streaming application with the provided data stream source and validate the real-time streaming results.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their Spark Streaming code. The report should include:
An explanation of the problem statement and requirements.
A description of the Spark Streaming operations applied, including the rationale behind each operation.
A discussion of any challenges faced during the task and how they were overcome.
An analysis of the real-time streaming results and their significance (e.g., insights gained, patterns identified).
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their Spark Streaming application and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the Spark Streaming application.
Clarity and organization of the Spark Streaming code.
Documentation and comments within the code.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply Apache Spark Streaming concepts effectively in real-time stream processing.
