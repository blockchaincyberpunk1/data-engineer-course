Spark Word Count

Objective: To introduce Apache Spark programming.

Task:

Introduction to Apache Spark:

Provide an introduction to Apache Spark and its significance in big data processing and analytics.
Sample Text Data:

Share a text file containing a sample document or text data with students. Ensure that the text data is suitable for word counting.
Spark Word Count Task:

Instruct students to implement a word count program using Apache Spark. They should:
Read the provided text data into an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) or DataFrame.
Perform word tokenization and preprocessing (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation).
Count the occurrences of each word in the text.
Display or save the word count results.
Code Structure and Documentation:

Encourage students to structure their Spark code in a clear and organized manner.
Require them to provide comments and documentation explaining the purpose of each section of the code, especially when working with Spark transformations and actions.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their Spark word count program with the provided text data and validate the word count results.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their Spark code. The report should include:
An explanation of the problem statement and requirements.
A description of the Spark programming steps and transformations applied.
A discussion of any challenges faced during the task and how they were overcome.
An analysis of the word count results, including the most frequent words in the text.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their Spark word count program and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the Spark word count program.
Clarity and organization of the Spark code.
Documentation and comments within the code.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply Apache Spark concepts effectively in a data processing task.
