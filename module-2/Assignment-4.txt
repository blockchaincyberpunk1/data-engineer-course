Spark Data Transformation

Objective: To understand data transformations in Spark.

Task:

Introduction to Data Transformations in Spark:

Provide an introduction to data transformations in Apache Spark, highlighting their importance in data processing and analytics.
Sample Dataset:

Share a sample dataset in a common format (e.g., CSV, JSON) with students. Ensure that the dataset is suitable for data transformations and contains various attributes.
Apache Spark Data Transformation Task:

Instruct students to use Apache Spark to perform data transformations on the provided dataset. They should:
Read the dataset into an RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) or DataFrame.
Apply a series of data transformations, including filtering, mapping (e.g., transforming columns), and aggregation (e.g., computing statistics).
Write the transformed data to a new file in a chosen format (e.g., CSV, Parquet).
Types of Transformations:

Specify the types of transformations students should perform, such as:
Filtering: Selecting specific rows based on criteria.
Mapping: Transforming or enriching data columns.
Aggregation: Calculating summary statistics or aggregating data based on specific attributes.
Joining: Combining data from multiple sources if applicable.
Code Structure and Documentation:

Encourage students to structure their Spark code in a clear and organized manner.
Require them to provide comments and documentation explaining the purpose of each section of the code, especially when applying Spark transformations and actions.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their Spark data transformation program with the provided dataset and validate the results of each transformation.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their Spark code. The report should include:
An explanation of the problem statement and requirements.
A description of the Spark data transformations applied, including the rationale behind each transformation.
A discussion of any challenges faced during the task and how they were overcome.
An analysis of the transformed data and its significance (e.g., insights gained, patterns identified).
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their Spark data transformation program and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the Spark data transformation program.
Clarity and organization of the Spark code.
Documentation and comments within the code.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply Apache Spark concepts effectively in data transformations.
