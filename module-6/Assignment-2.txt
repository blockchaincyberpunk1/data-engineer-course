Snowflake Schema Conversion

Objective: To explore snowflake schema modeling.

Task:

Introduction to Snowflake Schema:

Provide an introduction to snowflake schema modeling and its significance in database design for analytical purposes.
Existing Star Schema:

Share an existing star schema with students. The star schema should represent a data warehouse structure with fact and dimension tables related in a star-like fashion.
Snowflake Schema Conversion Task:

Instruct students to perform the following tasks:
Analyze the existing star schema and identify dimension tables that can be further normalized (i.e., dimension tables with attributes that can be split into separate related tables).
Convert the identified dimension tables into a snowflake schema structure by creating normalized tables and defining relationships between them.
Provide reasons and justifications for the conversion, explaining why certain dimensions were chosen for normalization.
Dimension Normalization:

Explain the concept of dimension normalization and how it differs from the star schema approach. Describe the advantages and disadvantages of each schema type.
Schema Diagrams:

Ask students to create schema diagrams that illustrate the original star schema and the resulting snowflake schema after conversion.
Documentation:

Instruct students to document the conversion process, including schema diagrams, table definitions, and explanations for the normalization decisions.
Benefits and Trade-Offs:

Have students discuss the benefits and trade-offs of using a snowflake schema in comparison to the original star schema. Consider factors such as query performance, storage efficiency, and maintenance.
Reporting and Analysis Scenarios:

Suggest several reporting and analysis scenarios that students can use to demonstrate the effectiveness of their snowflake schema. For example:
Calculate total sales revenue by product category for a specific time period.
Determine the top-selling products for a given year.
Analyze customer purchase behavior by region.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their snowflake schema conversion and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the snowflake schema conversion.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Quality of explanations for the normalization decisions.
Depth of analysis regarding the benefits and trade-offs of snowflake schema.
Ability to apply snowflake schema concepts effectively in converting a star schema.
