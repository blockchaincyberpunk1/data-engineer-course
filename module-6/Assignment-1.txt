Star Schema Design

Objective: To understand star schema modeling.

Task:

Introduction to Star Schema:

Provide an introduction to star schema modeling and its significance in designing data warehouses for analytical purposes.
Fictional Sales Data Warehouse:

Describe the scenario: Students are tasked with designing a star schema for a fictional sales data warehouse. The data warehouse is intended to store and enable analysis of sales-related data, including information about products, customers, sales transactions, and time.
Star Schema Design Task:

Instruct students to perform the following tasks in the star schema design:
Identify Fact Table: Choose a fact table that represents the central business process. In this case, it's the sales transactions.
Design Dimension Tables: Create dimension tables that provide context to the fact table. Dimensions may include Product, Customer, Date/Time, and any other relevant attributes.
Define Relationships: Establish relationships between the fact table and dimension tables to enable meaningful queries and analyses.
Define Hierarchies: If applicable, define hierarchies within dimension tables (e.g., product categories, time hierarchies).
Populate with Sample Data: Populate the fact and dimension tables with sample data to illustrate the structure.
Benefits of Star Schema:

Instruct students to explain the benefits of using a star schema for analytical purposes. They should discuss advantages such as:
Simplified Querying: How a star schema simplifies queries and allows for faster data retrieval.
Enhanced Performance: How it improves query performance for complex analytical tasks.
Intuitive Structure: How it provides an intuitive structure for business users to navigate data.
Scalability: How it supports scalability for handling large volumes of data.
Flexibility: How it allows for easy addition of new dimensions and facts as business requirements evolve.
Reporting and Analysis Scenarios:

Suggest several reporting and analysis scenarios that students can use to demonstrate the effectiveness of their star schema. For example:
Calculate total sales revenue by product category for a specific time period.
Determine the top-selling products for a given year.
Analyze customer purchase behavior by region.
Documentation:

Ask students to document their star schema design, including schema diagrams, table definitions, and explanations of relationships.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their star schema design and its benefits to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the star schema design.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Quality and depth of the explanation of star schema benefits.
Ability to apply star schema concepts effectively for analytical purposes.
