Objective: To set up a cloud-based data warehouse.

Task:

Introduction to Cloud Data Warehouses:

Provide an introduction to cloud-based data warehouses and their significance in modern data analytics and business intelligence.
Choice of Cloud Platform:

Allow students to choose a cloud platform for this assignment, such as Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Microsoft Azure Synapse Analytics.
Cloud Data Warehouse Setup Task:

Instruct students to perform the following tasks in setting up a cloud-based data warehouse:
Create a Data Warehouse: Create a data warehouse instance on the chosen cloud platform.
Data Loading: Load sample data into the data warehouse. You can provide a dataset or ask students to find a suitable dataset for their scenario.
SQL Queries: Write SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data from the data warehouse. Encourage students to perform tasks such as filtering, aggregating, and joining data to demonstrate their understanding of SQL.
SQL Queries and Analysis:

Steps taken to create the data warehouse instance.
Description of the sample data used.
SQL queries written for analysis.
Results and observations from executing the queries.
Any challenges encountered during the setup and analysis.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their cloud data warehouse setup and analysis to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Security and Cost Considerations:

Emphasize the importance of adhering to security best practices and cost management when working with cloud resources. Students should consider access controls, data encryption, and cost monitoring.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the cloud data warehouse setup.
Clarity and organization of the documentation.
Quality and effectiveness of SQL queries and data analysis.
Depth of analysis in addressing the assigned tasks.
Consideration of security and cost management best practices.
