MongoDB Document Creation

Objective: To understand NoSQL document stores, specifically MongoDB.

Task:

Introduction to MongoDB:

Provide an introduction to MongoDB as a NoSQL document database and its significance in modern data storage.
Database Setup:

Instruct students to set up a MongoDB database either locally or using a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas. Ensure they have the necessary credentials and access to the database.
Document Creation:

Task students with creating a sample MongoDB database and populating it with documents representing fictional data. They can choose a scenario, such as products, customers, or any other relevant data, and create a collection for it.
MongoDB Shell or Driver:

Allow students to choose between using the MongoDB shell or a MongoDB driver (e.g., PyMongo for Python) to perform the following operations:
Insert: Insert multiple documents into the collection.
Update: Modify one or more documents in the collection.
Query: Write MongoDB queries to retrieve specific data from the collection.
Sample Document Tasks:

Specify the tasks for creating sample documents, such as:
Insert a set of product documents with attributes like name, price, and category.
Update the price of a specific product.
Write a query to retrieve all products in a particular category.
Add customer documents with attributes like name, email, and address.
Write a query to find customers who have made a purchase in the last month.
Document Validation:

Encourage students to ensure that their documents are well-structured and adhere to a consistent schema, even in a NoSQL database.
Documentation and Queries:

Ask students to document the MongoDB commands and queries they used to insert, update, and query documents. Include explanations for the purpose of each operation.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their MongoDB database by executing the provided queries and validate the query results.
Report:

Require students to submit a written report alongside their MongoDB documents and queries. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and database setup.
Details about the documents created and the collections used.
Descriptions of the MongoDB commands and queries applied.
Query results with sample data or screenshots.
Any observations, challenges, or lessons learned during the task.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the MongoDB documents and queries.
Clarity and organization of the MongoDB commands and queries.
Proper use of MongoDB syntax and techniques.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply MongoDB concepts effectively for document creation and manipulation.
