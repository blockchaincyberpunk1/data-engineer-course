Cassandra Data Modeling

Objective: To explore NoSQL data modeling in Cassandra.

Task:

Introduction to Cassandra Data Modeling:

Provide an introduction to Apache Cassandra and its significance in NoSQL data modeling, particularly for time-series data.
Scenario and Data Requirements:

Describe the scenario: Students are tasked with modeling data for a time-series application, such as IoT sensor data, log events, or financial transactions.
Specify the data requirements, including the types of information to be stored, time-based data points, and any other relevant attributes.
Data Modeling Task:

Instruct students to create a data model in Apache Cassandra to efficiently store and retrieve time-series data. They should consider the following aspects:
Table Design: Create one or more tables to represent the time-series data.
Primary Keys: Define primary keys that support efficient data retrieval based on time or other relevant criteria.
Clustering Columns: Determine the appropriate clustering columns for sorting data within partitions.
Data Types: Choose appropriate data types for storing timestamps and other data points.
Partitioning Strategy: Explain the partitioning strategy used and its rationale (e.g., time-based, entity-based).
Denormalization: Consider denormalization for optimized queries and data retrieval.
Sample Data Insertion:

Provide students with sample time-series data points and ask them to insert these data points into their Cassandra data model to validate its effectiveness.
Querying the Data:

Task students with writing Cassandra queries to retrieve specific time-series data, such as data points within a given time range or data for a particular entity.
Documentation and Explanations:

Encourage students to document their data model design, including table schemas, primary keys, and clustering columns.
Ask them to provide explanations for the rationale behind their data modeling choices.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their Cassandra data model by executing the provided queries and validating the query results.
Report:

Require students to submit a written report alongside their Cassandra data model design and queries. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and data modeling requirements.
Details about the Cassandra tables and schema they created.
Explanations of the primary key design, partitioning strategy, and clustering columns.
Examples of Cassandra queries applied to retrieve time-series data.
Query results with sample data or screenshots.
Any observations, challenges, or lessons learned during the task.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and efficiency of the Cassandra data model.
Clarity and organization of the Cassandra schema and queries.
Proper use of Cassandra data modeling techniques.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply NoSQL data modeling principles effectively for time-series data.
