Choose the Right Database

Objective: To analyze use cases for relational and NoSQL databases.

Task:

Introduction to Database Types:

Provide an introduction to relational and NoSQL databases, highlighting their characteristics and strengths.
Data Storage Scenarios:

Present students with several data storage scenarios, each representing a different use case. Examples of scenarios include:
Social Media Posts: Storing user-generated content, comments, and likes.
Financial Transactions: Recording and processing financial transactions for a banking application.
E-commerce Product Catalogs: Managing product information, pricing, and inventory.
IoT Sensor Data: Collecting and analyzing data from sensors in a smart city or industrial setting.
Content Management: Managing articles, images, and multimedia content for a news website.
Database Selection and Justification:

Task students with recommending whether a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) is more suitable for each scenario. They should justify their choices based on the following criteria:
Data Structure: Analyze the structure of the data to determine if it is highly structured (relational) or semi-structured/unstructured (NoSQL).
Scalability: Consider the scalability requirements, such as read and write throughput, and whether horizontal scaling is necessary.
Consistency vs. Flexibility: Assess the need for strict data consistency (relational) versus schema flexibility (NoSQL).
Query Complexity: Evaluate the complexity of queries and the need for complex joins or aggregations.
Data Volume: Consider the expected data volume and whether it is suitable for the chosen database type.
Use Case Examples: Provide real-world examples or case studies that support their recommendations.
Presentation or Report:

Instruct students to present their recommendations in the form of a presentation or a written report. They should provide clear justifications for their choices and highlight key considerations for each scenario.
Class Discussion:

Facilitate a class discussion where students can share their recommendations and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different database types for various use cases.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and rationale of database recommendations.
Depth of analysis and consideration of relevant criteria.
Ability to apply knowledge of database types to real-world scenarios.
Quality of presentation or report.
Active participation in the class discussion.
