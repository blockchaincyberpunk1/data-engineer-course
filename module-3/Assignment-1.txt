Database Design and Normalization

Objective: To understand database design and normalization principles.

Task:

Introduction to Database Design and Normalization:

Provide an introduction to the importance of database design and normalization in creating efficient and maintainable database systems.
Scenario and Requirements:

Describe the scenario: Students are tasked with designing a relational database schema for a fictional online bookstore named "BookZone."
Specify the requirements for the database schema, including the types of information to be stored, such as books, authors, customers, orders, and inventory.
Database Design:

Instruct students to design the relational database schema for BookZone. This should include:
Creating tables for each entity (e.g., books, authors, customers, orders, inventory).
Defining appropriate primary keys and foreign keys to establish relationships between tables.
Ensuring that the schema supports the required data integrity constraints.
Normalization:

Explain the concept of normalization in relational databases and its benefits for data consistency and efficiency.
Task students with normalizing their database schema to at least the 3rd normal form (3NF).
Encourage them to identify and resolve any data redundancy issues through normalization.
Sample Data and Queries:

Provide a sample dataset and a set of sample SQL queries that students can use to test their database schema. These queries should involve data retrieval, insertion, and modification.
Code and Documentation:

Instruct students to create the SQL script for their database schema and include comments and documentation to explain the purpose of each table, relationship, and constraint.
Testing and Validation:

Ask students to test their database schema by executing the provided sample queries and validating the results. Ensure that the schema enforces data integrity.
Report:

Require students to submit a written report alongside their SQL script. The report should include:
An overview of the problem statement and database requirements.
A description of the database schema, including tables, keys, relationships, and constraints.
An explanation of the normalization process and the achieved normal form.
An analysis of the sample data and query results, with any observations or improvements suggested.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their database design and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and completeness of the database schema.
Clarity and organization of the SQL script.
Proper documentation and comments within the script.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply database design and normalization principles effectively.
