SQL Queries

Objective: To practice SQL for data retrieval.

Task:

Introduction to SQL Queries:

Provide an introduction to SQL (Structured Query Language) and its significance in data retrieval from relational databases.
Database Schema:

Share a pre-designed relational database schema with students. You can use a fictional e-commerce website database as an example. The schema should include tables for products, customers, orders, and other relevant entities.
SQL Query Tasks:

Task students with writing SQL queries to retrieve specific information from the provided database schema. Examples of query tasks include:
Retrieve a list of all products in the catalog.
Find the total number of orders placed.
Get the details of all customers who have made a purchase in the last month.
Calculate the total sales revenue for a specific product category.
Find the top-selling products by quantity sold.
Retrieve a list of customers who have not placed any orders.
Query Complexity:

Specify the complexity level for each query task, ranging from basic to advanced, to challenge students with a variety of SQL query types.
SQL Query Submission:

Instruct students to write and submit their SQL queries in a digital format (e.g., as a text document or SQL script).
Testing and Validation:

Ask students to test their SQL queries against the provided database schema and validate the query results. Ensure that the queries return accurate and meaningful data.
Report:

Require students to submit a written report alongside their SQL queries. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and query tasks.
The SQL queries they developed to address each task.
An explanation of the logic and rationale behind each query.
The actual query results with sample data or screenshots.
Any observations, challenges, or optimizations they encountered during the task.
Peer Review (Optional):

If time permits, students can review and provide feedback on their peers' SQL queries. This encourages collaboration and peer learning.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the SQL queries.
Clarity and organization of the SQL code.
Proper use of SQL syntax and techniques.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply SQL concepts effectively for data retrieval.
