ETL Pipeline Design

Objective: To design an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline.

Task:

Introduction to ETL Pipelines:

Provide an introduction to ETL pipelines and their significance in data integration and processing.
Choice of ETL Tool or Framework:

Allow students to choose an ETL tool or framework of their choice for this assignment. Examples include Apache NiFi, Apache Airflow, Talend, or any other relevant ETL tool.
ETL Pipeline Design Task:

Instruct students to design a simple ETL pipeline using the selected tool or framework. The pipeline should include the following components:
Source(s): Specify the source(s) from which data will be extracted. This can be a database, file system, API, or any other data source.
Transformations: Define the data transformations that will be applied to the extracted data. This may include cleaning, filtering, aggregating, or enriching the data.
Destination(s): Identify the destination(s) where the transformed data will be loaded. This can be a data warehouse, database, cloud storage, or another data repository.
ETL Pipeline Guidelines:

Provide guidelines for designing the ETL pipeline, including:
Data Source Selection: Explain how students should choose and connect to data sources.
Transformation Logic: Describe the types of transformations to be applied and the business rules to consider.
Data Loading: Specify the loading mechanism and destination choices.
High-Level Pipeline Design:

Instruct students to create a high-level design or flowchart of the ETL pipeline. This should illustrate the sequence of operations, including extraction, transformations, and loading.
Code or Configuration Snippets:

If applicable, students can provide code snippets or configuration files that represent their ETL pipeline components. This demonstrates their understanding of the chosen tool or framework.
Testing and Validation Plan (Optional):

Optionally, students can outline a plan for testing and validating their ETL pipeline design. This plan should include strategies for data quality checks and validation of transformations.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their ETL pipeline design. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and the chosen ETL tool or framework.
Detailed descriptions of the ETL pipeline components, including sources, transformations, and destinations.
High-level pipeline design or flowchart.
Code or configuration snippets (if applicable).
Any testing and validation plans (if included).
Reflections on design decisions and considerations.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their ETL pipeline design and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Clarity and completeness of the ETL pipeline design.
Appropriateness of the chosen ETL tool or framework.
Documentation and explanations within the report.
Quality of the high-level pipeline design or flowchart.
Consideration of data source, transformations, and destination choices.
