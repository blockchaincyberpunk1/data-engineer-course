Hive UDF Development

Objective: To create custom functions in Hive.

Task:

Introduction to Hive UDFs:

Provide an introduction to Hive User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and their significance in extending Hive's functionality for custom data transformations and analysis.
Hadoop and Hive Setup:

Ensure that students have access to an Apache Hadoop cluster with Hive installed and properly configured.
UDF Development Task:

Instruct students to develop a custom Hive User-Defined Function (UDF) in a programming language of their choice. The UDF should perform a specific data transformation or analysis task.
UDF Development Guidelines:

Provide guidelines for UDF development, including:
Language Choice: Allow students to choose the programming language for their UDF (e.g., Java, Python, Scala).
Input and Output: Specify the input parameters and expected output format of the UDF.
Functionality: Describe the data transformation or analysis task that the UDF should accomplish.
Error Handling: Encourage error handling and validation within the UDF code.
UDF Demonstration:

Instruct students to demonstrate the usage of their UDF in Hive queries. They should write HiveQL queries that incorporate their custom UDF to perform data transformations or analyses on a provided dataset.
Code Structure and Documentation:

Encourage students to structure their UDF code in a clear and organized manner.
Require them to provide comments and documentation within the code, explaining the purpose of the UDF, input parameters, and expected behavior.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their UDF by executing Hive queries that involve their custom function. They should validate the results of the queries.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their UDF code. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and Hive setup.
Descriptions of the UDF's functionality and input/output parameters.
UDF code with comments and explanations.
Examples of Hive queries that use the custom UDF.
Results and observations from executing the queries.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their custom Hive UDFs and demonstrate their usage in Hive queries to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the custom Hive UDF.
Clarity and organization of the UDF code.
Documentation and comments within the UDF code.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to develop and demonstrate a custom Hive UDF for data transformation or analysis.
