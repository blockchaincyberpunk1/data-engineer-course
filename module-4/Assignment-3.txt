Hadoop Streaming

Objective: To explore Hadoop Streaming for non-Java programming languages.

Task:

Introduction to Hadoop Streaming:

Provide an introduction to Hadoop Streaming and its significance in allowing non-Java programming languages to interact with Hadoop.
Hadoop Setup:

Ensure that students have access to an Apache Hadoop cluster, either locally or in a cloud-based environment, and that Hadoop is properly configured.
Sample Text Data:

Share a text file containing a sample document with students. Ensure that the text data is suitable for word counting and is in a format compatible with Hadoop (e.g., HDFS).
Hadoop Streaming Task:

Instruct students to use Hadoop Streaming to implement the classic "Word Count" program in a non-Java programming language of their choice (e.g., Python or Ruby). They should create mapper and reducer scripts in their chosen language.
Mapper and Reducer Scripts:

Task students with developing two separate scripts: a mapper script and a reducer script.
Mapper Script: The mapper script should read input data, tokenize it into words, and emit key-value pairs for each word (e.g., "word" => 1).
Reducer Script: The reducer script should receive key-value pairs from the mapper, group them by key (word), and calculate the total word count for each word.
Hadoop Streaming Execution:

Guide students on how to execute their Hadoop Streaming job using the provided mapper and reducer scripts in their chosen non-Java language.
Code Structure and Documentation:

Encourage students to structure their mapper and reducer scripts in a clear and organized manner.
Require them to provide comments and documentation within the scripts, explaining the purpose of each section of the code.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their Hadoop Streaming Word Count program by running it on the provided text data and validate the word count results.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their Hadoop Streaming code. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and Hadoop setup.
Descriptions of the mapper and reducer scripts, including code snippets.
Explanations of the logic behind word counting in their chosen non-Java language.
Test results and validation of word count results.
Any challenges encountered during the task and how they were addressed.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their Hadoop Streaming Word Count program and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the Hadoop Streaming Word Count program.
Clarity and organization of the mapper and reducer scripts.
Documentation and comments within the scripts.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply Hadoop Streaming concepts effectively in a non-Java programming language.
