Hive Data Analysis

Objective: To understand data querying with Hive.

Task:

Introduction to Hive:

Provide an introduction to Apache Hive and its significance in data querying and analysis in a Hadoop ecosystem.
Hadoop and Hive Setup:

Ensure that students have access to an Apache Hadoop cluster with Hive installed and properly configured.
Dataset:

Share a dataset with students in a format such as CSV files. The dataset should contain relevant data for analysis, and it should be suitable for creating an external table in Hive.
Hive Data Analysis Task:

Instruct students to perform the following tasks using Apache Hive:
Create an external table in Hive based on the provided dataset.
Load the data into the external table.
Write SQL queries to perform data analysis tasks like aggregation, filtering, and sorting.
SQL Queries:

Task students with writing SQL queries in HiveQL to address specific data analysis tasks. Examples of tasks include:
Aggregation: Calculate the total, average, minimum, or maximum values of certain columns.
Filtering: Retrieve rows that meet specific criteria, such as date ranges or conditions.
Sorting: Sort the data based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.
Code Structure and Documentation:

Encourage students to structure their HiveQL queries in a clear and organized manner.
Require them to provide comments and documentation within the queries, explaining the purpose of each query and any assumptions made.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their HiveQL queries on the provided dataset and validate the results of their data analysis tasks.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their HiveQL queries. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and Hive setup.
Descriptions of the dataset and the external table created.
HiveQL queries for data analysis tasks with explanations.
Results of the data analysis, including tables or visualizations if applicable.
Any observations, challenges, or lessons learned during the task.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their Hive data analysis findings and queries to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the HiveQL queries for data analysis.
Clarity and organization of the HiveQL code.
Documentation and comments within the queries.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to apply Hive concepts effectively for data analysis tasks.
