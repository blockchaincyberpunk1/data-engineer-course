HDFS File Manipulation

Objective: To understand HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System).

Task:

Introduction to HDFS:

Provide an introduction to HDFS, explaining its role in distributed data storage and its significance in the Hadoop ecosystem.
Setup and Configuration:

Ensure that students have access to an HDFS cluster, either locally or in a cloud-based environment. They should have the necessary permissions to perform file operations.
HDFS File Manipulation Task:

Instruct students to write code in Python or Java to interact with HDFS. They should perform the following file operations:
Create: Create a new file or directory in HDFS.
Read: Read the contents of a file from HDFS.
Update: Update the contents of an existing file in HDFS.
Delete: Delete a file or directory from HDFS.
Basic File Operations:

Ask students to implement additional basic file operations in their code, such as:
List Files: List the files and directories within a specified HDFS directory.
Check File Status: Retrieve information about a specific file, such as size, modification time, and owner.
Code Structure and Documentation:

Encourage students to structure their Python or Java code in a clear and organized manner.
Require them to provide comments and documentation explaining the purpose of each section of the code, especially when interacting with HDFS.
Testing and Validation:

Instruct students to test their HDFS file manipulation code by creating, reading, updating, and deleting files and directories in HDFS. They should also validate the results of basic file operations.
Report:

Ask students to submit a written report alongside their code. The report should include:
An overview of the assignment and HDFS setup.
A description of the HDFS file manipulation tasks and the code implemented.
Explanations of the code's logic and how each file operation is performed.
Test results and validation of file operations.
Any challenges encountered during the task and how they were addressed.
Presentation (Optional):

If time permits, students can present their HDFS file manipulation code and findings to the class. This allows for peer review and discussion.
Evaluation Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the HDFS file manipulation code.
Clarity and organization of the code.
Documentation and comments within the code.
Quality and completeness of the written report.
Ability to interact with HDFS and perform basic file operations effectively.
